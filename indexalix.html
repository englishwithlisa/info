  <h2>Motivation and Methods</h2>
  <p>
  SLA( Second Language Acquisition) tends to vary from culture to culture.  From my own experience, the emotionally driven approach is universally successful for positive language transfer.  For adults and children, experiencing a lesson that reflects instances from their daily life or their interest builds a positive learning experience.  This allows the student to build language skills and their personalities while using the language.  This my main focus as an ESL teacher, to balance those to aspects of language while highlighting cultural nuances. 
  </p>

  <h2>Lesson Plans</h2>
  <p>
    I tailor my lessons to each learner and document our classes in a joint file - a unique record of our learning. We will review past topics at increasing intervals for maximum long-term integration. I suggest home practice assignments after each
    class.<br/>
    <em>Kid’s classes</em>: The classes are fast-paced. I use songs, stories, games, puzzles, physical movement and crafts to create a fun and holistic learning experience.   <br />
    <em>Adult’s classes</em>: Each class centres on one topic and one source that expresses the topic. The source could be a song, a video, a poem or a text, often from relevant articles or pop culture. We extract the important vocabulary, as well as practicing grammar and having a small discussion.<br />
