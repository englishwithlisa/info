  <h2>Motivation and Methods</h2>
  <p>
    My lessons engage the learner on an emotional level and involve use of critical thinking skills. I see language-learning as a personal journey filled with creative expression and puzzles to solve. I grew up in the UK and I love British culture. I
    have also travelled, and been impressed by the way English is spoken around a table where each person has a different native tongue. English is for everyone.
  </p>

  <h2>Lesson Plans</h2>
  <p>
    I tailor my lessons to each learner and document our classes in a joint file - a unique record of our learning. We will review past topics at increasing intervals for maximum long-term integration. I suggest home practice assignments after each
    class.<br/>
    <em>Kid’s classes</em>: The classes are fast-paced. I use songs, stories, games, puzzles, physical movement and crafts to create a fun and holistic learning experience.   <br />
    <em>Adult’s classes</em>: Each class centres on one topic and one source that expresses the topic. The source could be a song, a video, a poem or a text, often from relevant articles or pop culture. We extract the important vocabulary, as well as practicing grammar and having a small discussion.<br />
  </p>

  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  <p>
    I received my Bachelor's degree in Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. As further studies I completed various teaching qualifications: a TESOL; a TEFL for young learner’s; a Children's Yoga teacher training; and a Mindfulness in Education
    course. I have worked in schools and kindergartens in Moscow and Berlin, and I have taught online to schools in China. I have organised adult education groups in art galleries and bars. Currently, I work freelance teaching private lessons to
    children and adults.
